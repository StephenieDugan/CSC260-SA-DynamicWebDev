                I expect my future job to have at least a couple of these qualities but ideally I'd like them all.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>1) Make a substancial amount of money (About 60k)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>2) Work on more creative projects like character or level building or design</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>3) Have fun at my job so I don't feel like I'm actually working (I know, unheard of)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>4) Don't get pushed over by people, especially coworkers, when presenting and/or working on tasks</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>5) I would love to work for companies like Blizzard in the Diablo games or on Hades by Epic because they a cinematic masterpieces </p>
